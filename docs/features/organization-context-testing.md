# **Organization Context Integration - Manual Testing Checklist**

## **Pre-Testing Setup**
- [ ] Ensure application is running locally (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Database is connected and seeded with test organizations
- [ ] User authentication is configured
- [ ] Browser DevTools open for debugging

---

## **5.2 Manual Testing Checklist**

### ** Phase 1: Organization Selection Flow**

#### **1.1 Organization Search & Selection**
- [ ] **Navigate to Organizations Page**
  - Navigate to `/organizations` 
  - Verify search interface is displayed
  - Verify search input and button are visible

- [ ] **Organization Search Functionality**
  - Search for "clinic" in the search field
  - Verify results are displayed (should show â‰¥1 organizations)
  - Verify organization cards show name, address, and contact info
  - Search for non-existent term "xyz123"
  - Verify "No organizations found" message appears

- [ ] **Organization Selection**
  - Select an organization from search results
  - Verify organization is highlighted/selected
  - Verify selection confirmation message appears
  - Verify organization state is stored (check localStorage in DevTools)

#### **1.2 Search Validation**
- [ ] **Minimum Length Validation**
  - Enter 1-2 characters in search field
  - Click search button
  - Verify validation error appears
  - Enter â‰¥3 characters and verify search works

---

### ** Phase 2: State Persistence & Navigation**

#### **2.1 Cross-Page Navigation**
- [ ] **Organization Selection Persistence**
  - Select an organization on `/organizations` page
  - Navigate to `/dashboard`
  - **Verify organization name is displayed** in header/UI
  - Navigate back to `/organizations`
  - Verify the same organization is still selected

- [ ] **Page Refresh Resilience**
  - Select an organization
  - Refresh the browser page (F5 or Cmd+R)
  - **Verify organization state persists** after refresh
  - Verify organization name is still displayed

#### **2.2 Browser Storage Validation**
- [ ] **LocalStorage Verification**
  - Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage
  - Select an organization
  - Verify `selectedOrganization` key exists with correct data
  - Clear localStorage manually
  - Verify app gracefully handles missing organization state

---

### ** Phase 3: Exercise Generation Integration**

#### **3.1 Clinic ID Auto-Population**
- [ ] **Pre-Population on Load**
  - Select an organization with clinic ID (e.g., "CLINIC-001")
  - Navigate to `/generate` (exercise generation page)
  - **Verify clinic ID field is pre-populated** with organization's clinic ID
  - Verify clinic ID field is visible and editable

#### **3.2 Organization Context Display**
- [ ] **Organization Visibility**
  - On generate page, verify organization name is displayed
  - Check for "Working with: [Organization Name]" or similar indicator
  - Verify organization context is clear to user

#### **3.3 Form Persistence Across Operations**
- [ ] **Clinic ID Persistence**
  - Fill out exercise generation form with clinical scenario
  - Submit form to generate exercises
  - After exercises are generated, click "Generate New Exercises"
  - **Verify clinic ID remains populated** (doesn't get cleared)
  - Verify organization context is maintained

#### **3.4 Multiple Generation Cycles**
- [ ] **State Consistency**
  - Generate exercises (1st cycle)
  - Click "Generate New Exercises" button
  - Verify clinic ID persists (2nd cycle)
  - Repeat for 3rd cycle
  - Verify organization context maintained throughout

---

### ** Phase 4: Authentication Integration**

#### **4.1 User Profile Loading**
- [ ] **Login Integration**
  - Log out and log back in
  - Navigate to generate page
  - Verify user profile loads (check console for profile loading)
  - Verify organization/clinic context is restored

#### **4.2 Organization Selection Priority**
- [ ] **User vs Selected Organization**
  - If user has default organization in profile, verify it loads
  - Manually select different organization
  - Verify manual selection overrides default
  - Verify selected organization persists after navigation

---

### ** Phase 5: Error Handling & Edge Cases**

#### **5.1 Network Error Scenarios**
- [ ] **Organization Search Failure**
  - Disable network in DevTools (offline mode)
  - Try to search for organizations
  - Verify appropriate error message is shown
  - Re-enable network and verify recovery

#### **5.2 Data Integrity**
- [ ] **Invalid Organization Data**
  - Manually corrupt organization data in localStorage
  - Refresh page
  - Verify app gracefully handles invalid data
  - Verify fallback behavior (clear invalid state)

#### **5.3 Missing Clinic ID Handling**
- [ ] **Organization Without Clinic ID**
  - Select organization that has no clinic_id in database
  - Navigate to generate page
  - Verify form still works (clinic ID field empty but functional)
  - Verify no errors in console

---

### ** Phase 6: User Experience Validation**

#### **6.1 UI/UX Verification**
- [ ] **Visual Design**
  - Verify organization selector has consistent styling
  - Check responsive design on mobile/tablet
  - Verify loading states are smooth
  - Check for accessibility (keyboard navigation)

#### **6.2 Performance**
- [ ] **Load Times**
  - Verify organization search is responsive (<1s)
  - Check that organization state loading doesn't delay page render
  - Verify no excessive API calls or memory leaks
