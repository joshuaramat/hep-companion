# HIPAA Compliance Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the HIPAA compliance measures implemented in the HEP Companion application.

## Security Measures

### 1. Access Control
- Non-root user implementation in containers
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for database
- Secure password management using Docker secrets
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management and timeout policies

### 2. Data Encryption
- TLS 1.2/1.3 for all communications
- Encrypted data at rest (PostgreSQL)
- Secure key management
- Encrypted backups
- SSL/TLS for all API endpoints

### 3. Audit Logging
- Comprehensive logging of all system access
- Database access logging
- API request logging
- Authentication attempts logging
- Automated log rotation and retention

### 4. Network Security
- Internal network isolation
- Firewall rules
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection
- Regular security scanning

### 5. Backup and Recovery
- Automated daily backups
- Encrypted backup storage
- Regular backup testing
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Business continuity plan

## Technical Implementation

### Container Security
```yaml
# Non-root user implementation
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
USER nextjs
```

### Network Policies
```yaml
networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true  # No direct internet access
```

### Security Headers
```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;
```

## Compliance Procedures

## Monitoring and Alerts

### 1. System Monitoring

- Network traffic
- Security events

### 2. Alert Thresholds
- CPU usage > 80%
- Memory usage > 85%
- Disk usage > 90%
- Failed login attempts > 5
- Unauthorized access attempts

### 3. Notification Channels
- Email alerts
- SMS notifications
- Slack integration
- PagerDuty integration

## Documentation Requirements
