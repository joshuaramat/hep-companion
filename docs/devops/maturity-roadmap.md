## Gap Analysis

### Priority 1: Critical Gaps

#### 1. Dependency Management

**Current State:** Manual dependency updates
**Target State:** Automated vulnerability scanning and updates
**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities, technical debt

**Solution:**
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

#### 2. Error Tracking

**Current State:** No production error tracking
**Target State:** Real-time error monitoring with alerts
**Impact:** Unknown production issues, poor user experience

**Solution:**
```typescript
// src/lib/sentry.ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing(),
    new Sentry.Replay()
  ]
});
```

### Priority 2: Important Gaps

#### 3. Infrastructure as Code

**Current State:** Partial IaC implementation
**Target State:** Full infrastructure automation
**Impact:** Manual infrastructure changes, no version control

**Solution:**
```hcl
# terraform/main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = "hep-companion-cluster"
}
```

#### 4. API Documentation

**Current State:** No automated API docs
**Target State:** OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
**Impact:** Poor developer experience

**Solution:**
```typescript
// src/pages/api/docs.ts
import { withSwagger } from 'next-swagger-doc';

const swaggerHandler = withSwagger({
  definition: {
    openapi: '3.0.0',
    info: {
      title: 'HEP Companion API',
      version: '1.0.0',
    },
  },
  apiFolder: 'src/pages/api',
});

export default swaggerHandler();
```

### Priority 3: Nice-to-Have Gaps

#### 5. Performance Testing

**Current State:** No load testing
**Target State:** Automated performance benchmarks
**Impact:** Unknown performance limits

#### 6. Feature Flags

**Current State:** No feature flag system
**Target State:** Gradual rollout capabilities
**Impact:** Risky deployments
