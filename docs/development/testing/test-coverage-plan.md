# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
As of initial assessment, the project had approximately **7.5%** test coverage for statements. After implementing Phase 1 tests, we've increased to **11.2%** overall coverage, with **94-100%** coverage for core utilities and services. After implementing all the API route tests in Phase 2, we've reached approximately **80%** overall coverage across these routes, with some routes having lower individual coverage due to complex database interactions. With Phase 3 and Phase 4 complete, we now have over **83%** overall test coverage across the codebase. Phase 5 introduces comprehensive integration tests that verify the end-to-end functionality of critical user flows.

   - ✅ `/api/feedback` (91% coverage)
   - ✅ `/api/organizations` (40% coverage)
   - ✅ `/api/organizations/search` (85% coverage)
   - ✅ `/auth/callback` (100% coverage)
2. ✅ Mock Supabase and OpenAI responses
3. ✅ Test success scenarios and error handling
4. ✅ Verify proper status codes and response formats
5. ✅ Fix circular reference issues in Jest mocks
6. ✅ Ensure test stability and consistency

### Phase 3: React Components (Target: 70% coverage) ✅
1. ✅ Set up React Testing Library tests
2. ✅ Test component rendering and state changes
3. ✅ Test user interactions and event handling
4. ✅ Verify proper props handling and child component rendering

### Phase 4: React Hooks (Target: 75% coverage) ✅

2. ✅ Test hook behavior in isolation
3. ✅ Verify state management and side effects
4. ✅ Test timer behavior in useIdleTimeout
5. ✅ Test error handling in useErrorHandler
6. ✅ Test cleanup functions and resource management

### Phase 5: Integration Tests (Target: 80% coverage) ✅
1. ✅ Define critical user journeys
   - ✅ Prioritized authentication, exercise generation, feedback, and organization flows
2. ✅ Set up integration test environment
   - ✅ Configured Playwright for end-to-end testing
   - ✅ Implemented MSW for API mocking
   - ✅ Created test data management utilities
3. ✅ Implement Page Object Model pattern
   - ✅ Created page objects for main application pages
   - ✅ Developed reusable component interactions
4. ✅ Develop user-centric test scenarios
   - ✅ Structured tests from user perspective
   - ✅ Focused on outcomes rather than implementations
5. ✅ Create test helpers for common operations
   - ✅ Authentication and session management
   - ✅ Data verification utilities

## Test Implementation Guidelines

1. **Use appropriate testing libraries**
   - Jest for general testing
   - React Testing Library for component tests
   - Playwright for integration tests
   - MSW for API mocking

2. **Follow testing best practices**
   - Test behavior, not implementation
   - Write maintainable tests that won't break with refactoring
   - Keep tests independent and isolated
   - Use descriptive test names

3. **Mock external dependencies**
   - Supabase client
   - OpenAI API
   - Browser APIs (localStorage, fetch, etc.)

4. **Maintain test organization**
   - Keep test files close to implementation files
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Group related tests together

5. **Handle circular references properly**
   - Define mock implementations within Jest mock scope
   - Use unique variable names to avoid conflicts
   - Extract mock references after they're defined
   - Use dynamic imports in beforeAll hooks when needed

## Next Steps

We have successfully completed all 5 phases of our test coverage plan. The project now has comprehensive test coverage across multiple testing layers:

1. ✅ **Unit Tests**: Core utilities and services
2. ✅ **API Tests**: Server-side API routes
3. ✅ **Component Tests**: React components with React Testing Library
4. ✅ **Hook Tests**: Custom React hooks
5. ✅ **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user flows with Playwright

Future improvements to consider:
1. Set up continuous integration for automated test runs
2. Add visual regression testing
3. Implement performance testing
4. Expand test coverage for edge cases and error states
5. Add accessibility testing
