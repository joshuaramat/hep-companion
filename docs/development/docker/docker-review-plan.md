# Docker Implementation Review Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to review all Docker-related code and documentation in the HEP Companion project, ensuring accuracy, necessity, and adherence to software engineering best practices.

## Review Objectives

1. **Code Quality**: Ensure all Docker code is necessary, clean, and follows best practices
2. **Documentation Accuracy**: Verify documentation matches actual implementation
4. **Best Practices**: Ensure compliance with Docker and SWE best practices
5. **Security**: Verify security measures are properly implemented
6. **Performance**: Confirm optimization strategies are effective

- [ ] Uses .dockerignore appropriately
- [ ] Handles secrets securely
- [ ] Includes health checks
- [ ] Sets appropriate environment variables
- [ ] Uses COPY instead of ADD where appropriate
- [ ] Orders commands for optimal caching
```

### 2.2 Docker Compose Review
```
For each docker-compose file:
- [ ] Services are properly networked
- [ ] Volumes are correctly mounted
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Health checks are configured
- [ ] Resource limits are defined
- [ ] Restart policies are appropriate
- [ ] Dependencies are correctly specified
- [ ] Secrets are handled securely
- [ ] Networks are properly isolated
- [ ] Version is specified and current
```

### 2.3 Scripts Review
```
For each script:
- [ ] Has proper error handling
- [ ] Includes usage instructions
- [ ] Uses set -e for fail-fast behavior
- [ ] Variables are properly quoted
- [ ] Has appropriate permissions
- [ ] Includes logging
- [ ] Handles edge cases
- [ ] Is idempotent where applicable
```

## Phase 3: Documentation Verification

### 3.1 Cross-Reference Matrix
```
Code File                    | Documentation Files                    | Status
---------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------
Dockerfile                 | docker-quick-reference.md             | [ ]
docker-compose.yml         | docker-phase2-supabase.md            | [ ]
docker-compose.production  | HIPAA.md, disaster-recovery.md       | [ ]
backup.sh                  | disaster-recovery.md                  | [ ]
nginx/conf.d/default.conf  | HIPAA.md                             | [ ]
```

### 3.2 Documentation Accuracy Checklist
```
For each documentation file:
- [ ] Commands are tested and work

- [ ] Port numbers match configuration
- [ ] Environment variables are accurate
- [ ] Service names are consistent
