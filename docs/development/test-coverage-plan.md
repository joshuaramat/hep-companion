# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
As of initial assessment, the project had approximately **7.5%** test coverage for statements. After implementing Phase 1 tests, we've increased to **11.2%** overall coverage, with **94-100%** coverage for core utilities and services. The goal is to reach at least **70-80%** overall coverage.

## Priority Areas

1. **Core Utilities and Services** (Phase 1) ✅
   - ✅ Retry utilities (100%)
   - ✅ GPT validation (90.81%)
   - ✅ Input validation (93.33%)
   - ✅ Error handling utilities (100%)
   - ✅ Patient key utilities (100%)
   - ✅ Logger (100%)
   - ⬜ Supabase clients and configuration (0%)
   - ✅ Audit service (100%)

2. **API Routes** (Phase 2)
   - ⬜ `/api/generate` - Exercise suggestion generation (0%)
   - ⬜ `/api/feedback` - User feedback submission (0%)
   - ⬜ `/api/organizations` - Organization management (0%)
   - ⬜ Authentication callback handling (0%)

3. **React Components** (Phase 3)
   - ⬜ Form components (GenerateForm.tsx, 0%)
   - ⬜ ExerciseSuggestionsDisplay (0%)
   - ⬜ Authentication components (0%)
   - ⬜ Header and navigation components (0%)

4. **React Hooks** (Phase 4)
   - ⬜ useErrorHandler (0%)
   - ⬜ useIdleTimeout (0%)

5. **Integration Tests** (Phase 5)
   - ⬜ Complete user flows
   - ⬜ Authentication and authorization flows
   - ⬜ Exercise generation and feedback submission

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Utilities and Services (Target: 40% coverage) ✅
1. ✅ Create tests for each utility in `/src/utils`
2. ✅ Set up mocks for external dependencies
3. ✅ Test error cases and edge conditions
4. ✅ Ensure high branch coverage for conditional logic

### Phase 2: API Routes (Target: 55% coverage)
1. Create tests for each API route
2. Mock Supabase and OpenAI responses
3. Test success scenarios and error handling
4. Verify proper status codes and response formats

### Phase 3: React Components (Target: 70% coverage)
1. Set up React Testing Library tests
2. Test component rendering and state changes
3. Test user interactions and event handling
4. Verify proper props handling and child component rendering

### Phase 4: React Hooks (Target: 75% coverage)
1. Set up custom hook testing with renderHook
2. Test hook behavior in isolation
3. Verify state management and side effects

### Phase 5: Integration Tests (Target: 80% coverage)
1. Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
2. Set up test environment with mocked backend
3. Test complete user journeys

## Test Implementation Guidelines

1. **Use appropriate testing libraries**
   - Jest for general testing
   - React Testing Library for component tests
   - MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

2. **Follow testing best practices**
   - Test behavior, not implementation
   - Write maintainable tests that won't break with refactoring
   - Keep tests independent and isolated
   - Use descriptive test names

3. **Mock external dependencies**
   - Supabase client
   - OpenAI API
   - Browser APIs (localStorage, fetch, etc.)

4. **Maintain test organization**
   - Keep test files close to implementation files
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Group related tests together

## Progress Tracking

| Phase | Target Coverage | Current Coverage | Status |
|-------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| 1     | 40%            | 11.2%            | Completed core utilities |
| 2     | 55%            | -                | Not Started |
| 3     | 70%            | -                | Not Started |
| 4     | 75%            | -                | Not Started |
| 5     | 80%            | -                | Not Started |

## Next Steps

The next focus is on Phase 2, which involves testing API routes. This will require:

1. Setting up more comprehensive mocking for Supabase and OpenAI
2. Testing both success and error paths for API endpoints
3. Ensuring proper response handling and status codes

Testing the API routes will significantly increase our coverage, as these files contain substantial portions of the application's business logic.
