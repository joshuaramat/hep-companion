# Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the security requirements for the HEP Companion application:

1. ✅ **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Enabled RLS on all tables
   - Created policies to ensure users can only access their own data
   - Blocked anonymous access to all data tables

2. ✅ **Audit Logging**
   - Created an audit_logs table to track all user actions
   - Implemented database triggers for automatic logging
   - Added application-level audit logging in API routes
   - Set up audit logs for both `/generate` and `/feedback` endpoints

3. ✅ **90-Day Purge Job**
   - Created cleanup_audit_logs() function
   - Scheduled cron job to run daily

4. ✅ **Patient Key Hashing**
   - Implemented SHA-256 hashing of MRN + clinic_id
   - Created utility functions for generating and verifying patient keys
   - Added patient_key column to prompts table

5. ✅ **Additional Security Measures**
   - Added Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - Implemented HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
   - Created authentication flow

## Files Changed/Added

### Database Migrations
- `scripts/migrations/01_security_schema.sql` - Schema changes for security
- `scripts/migrations/02_rls_policies.sql` - RLS policy implementation
- `scripts/migrations/apply-migrations.sh` - Script to apply migrations

> **Note**: The migrations have already been applied directly through the Supabase dashboard. The files are kept for documentation and reference.

### Security Utilities
- `src/utils/patient-key.ts` - SHA-256 hashing utilities
- `src/services/audit/index.ts` - Audit logging service

### API Routes
- `src/app/api/generate/route.ts` - Updated with authentication, patient key, and audit
- `src/app/api/feedback/route.ts` - New API endpoint with security features

### Authentication and Middleware
- `src/middleware.ts` - Added CSP, HSTS, and auth redirects
- `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Basic login page implementation

### Application Pages
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated with auth checks and patient identification fields
- `src/app/suggestions/page.tsx` - Updated with auth checks and secure feedback submission

### Documentation and Deployment
- `docs/security/README.md` - Detailed security documentation
- `scripts/deploy-security.js` - Deployment script for security features
- `SECURITY-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This implementation summary
- `README.md` - Updated with security information

## Verification Completed

The security implementation has been verified:

1. ✅ Database changes have been applied directly through the Supabase dashboard

2. ✅ Authentication flow is working:
   - Access is restricted without authentication
   - Redirect to login page works
   - Users can only access their own data

3. ✅ Audit logging is active:
   - Exercise suggestions generate audit logs
   - Feedback submissions are logged
   - Audit_logs table contains entries

4. ✅ Patient key hashing is functional:
   - MRN and clinic ID inputs are hashed
   - Hashed patient_key is stored in the prompts table
   - Original MRN is not stored in the database

5. ✅ Row-Level Security is effective:
   - Each user can only see their own data
   - Anonymous access is blocked

## Future Enhancements

1. Add password complexity requirements
2. Implement two-factor authentication
3. Add IP-based access restrictions
4. Enhance audit reporting with dashboards
5. Add automated security scanning
