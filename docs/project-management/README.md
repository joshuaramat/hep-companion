# Project Management Documentation

This directory contains project history, phase documentation, and planning materials for HEP Companion.

## Contents

### Project Phases

The HEP Companion project was developed in six major phases:

1. **[Phase 1: Security Foundation](./phases/phase-1-security.md)** - Security infrastructure, authentication, and HIPAA compliance setup
2. **[Phase 2: Exercise Management](./phases/phase-2-exercises.md)** - Exercise database, seeding, and management system
3. **[Phase 3: AI & Citations](./phases/phase-3-ai-citations.md)** - GPT-4o integration and citation system implementation
4. **[Phase 4: Testing](./phases/phase-4-testing.md)** - Comprehensive testing implementation and coverage
5. **[Phase 5: Verification](./phases/phase-5-verification.md)** - Feature verification and deployment readiness
6. **[Phase 6: Code Quality](./phases/phase-6-code-quality.md)** - Code quality improvements and documentation

### Additional Phase Documentation

- **[Phase 3 Test Results](./phases/phase-3-test-results.md)** - Detailed test results from Phase 3

### Planning Documents

- **[Roadmap](./roadmap.md)** - Future development roadmap and planned features
